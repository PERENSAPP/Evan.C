# Portfolio Evan Cheung. 
This is my portfolio website 

To get my portfolio online, I chose to use GitHub because I did not want to pay for a server. I could only use client-side languages. However, if I could use server-side languages, I would turn the HTML files into PHP files and make the contacts.html functional.
