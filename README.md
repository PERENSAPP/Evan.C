# Portfolio Evan Cheung. 
This is my portfolio website 

I decided to use GitHub to put my portfolio online because I didn't want to pay for a server. Since I could only use client-side languages, the contacts.html page couldn't have any functionality. But if I had the chance to use server-side languages, I would turn the HTML files into PHP files and make the contacts.html page work.
